re all<br>
<br>
We all know that cyberspace has come to an intense moment of<br>
confrontation; it will become more and more difficult to focus on the<br>
very reasons of the conflict opening, as the fog of war is<br>
rising. This Open letter is an effort to focus on what is happening.<br>
<br>
Hackers: behind all our actions there is a pulsating will to make<br>
justice and to protect our freedoms. Fighting injustice has long moved<br>
the hearts and souls of many people in history.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the state of asymmetric cyber warfare in 2011 is<br>
paradoxical: national defense departments against kids in their<br>
bedrooms, an exaggeration depicting well the deep necessity of reform<br>
faced by all forms of organized intelligence that existed before the<br>
proliferation of digital networks; namely the most populous one, the<br>
Internet, now 18 years old.<br>
<br>
As usual, the reasons why members of an organization like NATO are<br>
moved to fight are related to territorial control and predominance;<br>
likewise, the reasons moving the legions of Anonymous are in their<br>
deepest sense, and behind the lulz, a political stance supported by<br>
natives and, as such, have a huge constituent potential.<br>
<br>
The reasons that invigorate today the courage of the Legions of<br>
Anonymous are also very similar to the political reasons that made the<br>
Legion of Underground declare war to Iraq and China in 1999:<br>
<br>
the reiterated threats to the freedom of the population;<br>
<br>
the state&#39;s efforts to censor, monitor and manipulate the natural flow<br>
of information;<br>
<br>
the lies that monopolies, corporations and governments use to hide<br>
failures in the eyes of their citizens and clients;<br>
<br>
the resistance of nations to move out of obsolete forms of governance<br>
engulfed by media-dictatorships;<br>
<br>
the oppression against investigative journalists, hackers and such<br>
liminal figures operating on the edges of semiospheres;<br>
<br>
to name just a few.<br>
<br>
Since this scenario is not new, please consider the war that might be<br>
profiling ahead by reading further the statement below.<br>
<br>
Solid.<br>
<br>
LoU STRIKE OUT WITH INTERNATIONAL COALITION OF HACKERS:<br>
A JOINT STATEMENT BY 2600,<br>
THE CHAOS COMPUTER CLUB,<br>
THE CULT OF THE DEAD<br>
COW,<br>
!HISPAHACK,<br>
L0PHT HEAVY INDUSTRIES,<br>
PHRACK AND PULHAS<br>
<br>
Date: 7.1.1999<br>
<br>
An international coalition of hackers strongly condemns the Legion of<br>
the Underground&#39;s (LoU) recent &quot;declaration of war&quot; against the<br>
governments of Iraq and the People&#39;s Republic of China. Citing human<br>
rights violations and other repressive measures the LoU declared their<br>
intention to disrupt and disable Internet infrastructures in Iraq and<br>
China. In a decision that was more rash than wise, the LoU will do<br>
little to alter existing conditions and much to endanger the rights of<br>
hackers around the world.<br>
<br>
We - the undersigned - strongly oppose any attempt to use the power of<br>
hacking to threaten or destroy the information infrastructure of a<br>
country, for any reason. Declaring &quot;war&quot; against a country is the most<br>
irresponsible thing a hacker group could do. This has nothing to do<br>
with hacktivism or hacker ethics and is nothing a hacker could be<br>
proud of.<br>
<br>
Frank Rieger of the CCC said, &quot;Many hacker groups don&#39;t have a problem<br>
with Web hacks that raise public awareness about human rights<br>
violations. But we are very sensitive to people damaging networks and<br>
critical systems in repressive regimes or anywhere else.  The police<br>
and intelligence communities regard hacking as seditious. It is quite<br>
possible now that hackers - not only in totalitarian states - could be<br>
jailed or executed as &#39;cyberterrorists&#39; for the slightest infraction<br>
of the law.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is shortsighted and potentially counterproductive,&quot; added Reid<br>
Fleming of the cDc. &quot;One cannot legitimately hope to improve a<br>
nation&#39;s free access to information by working to disable its data<br>
networks.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Though we may agree with LoU that the atrocities in China and Iraq<br>
have got to stop, we do not agree with the methods they are<br>
advocating,&quot; said Space Rogue of the L0pht.<br>
<br>
Emmanuel Goldstein of 2600 said: &quot;This kind of threat, even if made<br>
idly, can only serve to further alienate hackers from mainstream<br>
society and help to spread the misperceptions we&#39;re constantly<br>
battling. And what happens when someone in another country decides<br>
that the United States needs to be punished for its human rights<br>
record? This is one door that will be very hard to close if we allow<br>
it to be opened.&quot;<br>
<br>
Governments worldwide are seeking to establish cyberspace as a new<br>
battleground for their artificial conflicts. The LoU has inadvertently<br>
legitimized this alarmist propoganda. With its dramatic announcement<br>
the LoU played into the hands of policy makers who want complete<br>
control over the Internet and are looking for reasons to seize it. If<br>
hackers solicit recognition as paramilitary factions then hacking in<br>
general will be seen as an act of war. Ergo, hackers will be viewed as<br>
legitimate targets of warring states.<br>
<br>
Strategic combat planning in the United States and among other nations<br>
has reached the point where real-world cases are needed to justify<br>
assigned budgets. The LoU is providing this real-world case now. We<br>
believe that the LoU should carefully investigate the idea of<br>
declaring &quot;war&quot; against China and Iraq.  Was it planted with them by<br>
someone with different interests in mind other than advancing human<br>
rights considerations?<br>
<br>
The signatories to this statement are asking hackers to reject all<br>
actions that seek to damage the information infrastructure of any<br>
country. DO NOT support any acts of &quot;Cyberwar.&quot; Keep the networks of<br>
communication alive. They are the nervous system for human progress.<br>
